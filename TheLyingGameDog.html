    <strong>Arthur</strong>
    <br>
    Bark! Bark! Bark!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>You:</strong>
    <br>
    <span class = "italic">Aw crap Arthur must have heard me! That dog always knows when anyone is lying!</span>

    <strong>Mother:</strong>
    <br>
    Hmmmm, seems like Arthur is trying to say something. As far as I can recall he always barks whenever Dad lies about eating cake.
    <br>
    <br>
    He knows he has diabetes. Also Arthur never barks like this, not even when the burglar tried breaking into our house last month.
    <br>

    Are you telling the truth, Player???

    <ul id="menu">
    <li><a href="https://azmanx234.github.io/TheLyingGameMomChoice1.html">Yes I am I really don't know what else to say mom</a>
    <li><a href="https://azmanx234.github.io/TheLyingGameMomChoice2.html">I dont know, maybe Arthur is barking at something else now. First time for everything right?</a>
    </ul>
